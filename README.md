# Rust Project

It's not easy to learn Rust.  
From my point of view, learning an programming language well has
these stages below:  
- Have a good understanding of its syntax;
- Know how to write common data structures and algorithms;
- Have the ability to write some utilities with syscall provided by OS;
- Have the ability to write some small project.
  
Now I would like to write some small utilities based on Linux to learn Rust. 
Before you read this repositories, I suggest you take a Stanfod class: CS110L. 
This is a great class to learn Rust. Also, I hope you have some experiences in 
system programming with C/C++. The book OSTEP will be a nice friend of you.  

The book "Understanding Unix/Linux Programming A Guide to Theory and Practice"
will be my reference. It's a great book to learn system programming on Linux 
with C. I will try to overwrite some examples from this book.
